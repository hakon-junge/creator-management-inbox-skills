description: Resolves every {{TOKEN}} the creator-management-inbox skills use (company, product, offer, rates, affiliate terms, payment terms, tools, escalation contact) from the user's own profile files in ~/.claude/inbox/profile/. Load it whenever another inbox skill needs a concrete fact about the user's company or deals, and before asserting any price, rate, commission, payment term or product claim in a draft. It never invents a value - an unfilled token means "unknown", and the calling skill leaves that claim out or asks. Also use it when the user asks "what does my profile say about X" or wants to update a fact.

# Company context: the user's facts

The other skills carry **method**. This skill supplies **facts**: when a skill
writes `{{AFFILIATE_RATE_STANDARD}}` or "per `deals.md`", the value comes from the
user's profile, never from memory, never from an earlier email.

## Where the profile lives

Run `inbox profile-dir` once per session. It prints the active folder:

- normal use: `~/.claude/inbox/profile/` (the user's own, private files)
- demo mode (`provider: demo` in settings): the fictional profile `demo_profile` picks

Creator notes live in `~/.claude/inbox/creators/` (demo: `<profile>/creators/`).
Find one with `inbox creator <name|handle|email|code>`.

## Which file answers which token

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `me.md` | `OPERATOR_*`, `ESCALATION_CONTACT`, `FINANCE_CONTACT`, tools (`EMAIL_PLATFORM`, `CRM_PLATFORM`, `CHAT_TOOL`, `DOCS_TOOL`, `DATA_AGENT`, `CALL_RECORDER`), `ONBOARDING_FORM_URL`, `TEAM_ROSTER`, working norms |
| `company.md` | `COMPANY*`, `PRODUCT*`, brand assets, `VALUE_PROP`, `CORE_FEATURES`, `CREDIT_UNIT`, `ICP1/2`, `TARGET_NICHES`, `EXCLUDED_NICHES`, `CURRENCY`, `PLAN_*`, `TRIAL_TERMS`, `CREATOR_PROMO_OFFER`, `CREATOR_TRIAL_GRANT`, `COMPETITOR_*`, `DIFFERENTIATORS` |
| `program.md` | how the program runs: `model`, `budget`, `success`, `pricing`, `deal_shape`, `creator_types`, `PROGRAM_PITCH`, `CURRENT_CAMPAIGN`, `CAMPAIGN_CALENDAR`, `CAMPAIGN_BUDGET` (internal only), `CREATORS_PER_CAMPAIGN`. Read through `inbox program`. |
| `deals.md` | `MIN_PIECES_FIRST_DEAL`, `TRACK_GATE_MEDIAN_VIEWS`, `CASH_FLOOR_FIRST_DEAL`, `PAYOUT_VENDOR`, `NET_TERMS`, `PAYMENT_SPEED_CLAIM`, tax (gross/net), procurement (`PO_PROCESS`, `TAX_FORMS`, `SUPPLIER_PORTAL`, `AP_RUN_DAY`), `BOOSTING_TERMS`, `USAGE_RIGHTS_RATES`, `EXCLUSIVITY_RATES`, `CONVERSION_VALUE`, `PAYBACK_WINDOW`, deal process, `CANCELLATION_TERMS`, `SEEDING_POLICY`, `SEEDING_FORM_URL`, giveaway limits |
| `rates.md` | the rate bands: `CPM_BANDS`, `GEO_TIER_1/2/3` and `GEO_VALUE_MULTIPLIERS`, `RATE_FLOOR_SHORTFORM`, `RATE_FLOOR_LONGFORM`, value per 1k views. Read through `inbox rate`, not by hand. |
| `affiliate.md` | every `AFFILIATE_*` token, `PAYOUT_THRESHOLD`, `PAYOUT_CADENCE`. First line `none` = no program: never mention one. |
| `voice.md` | the user's voice (loaded by `comms-style`) |
| `house-rules.md` | optional: decisions the user taught the workflow ("always add the brief link"). Always on when present |
| `settings.md` | provider, house-style switches, run log, link domains, teammates |
| `data-sources.md` | advanced, optional: CRM (`CRM_*`) and warehouse (`WAREHOUSE_*`, `TBL_*`, `COL_*`, `LEAK_*`, `REGIME_*`) |

Tokens by prefix: `CRM_FIELD_*`, `CRM_OBJ_*`, `TBL_*`, `COL_*`, `WAREHOUSE_*`,
`LEAK_*` all resolve from `data-sources.md`. If that file says `none` for them,
the capability that needs them is simply off - work from creator notes instead.

## Rules

1. **Unfilled means unknown.** A value that is `TODO`, blank or missing is not a
   gap to fill with a plausible guess. The calling skill drafts without that claim
   (and flags it ⚠️ in the run report), or asks the creator, or asks the user.
   A wrong commission rate or price in a creator email is worse than no number.
2. **`none` is an answer.** `CRM_PLATFORM: none` means "don't look for a CRM".
   `Program: none` in `affiliate.md` means "we have no affiliate program".
3. **Money facts are quoted exactly as written.** Rates, commissions, payout
   thresholds and terms go into drafts verbatim from the file.
4. **The profile beats everything else.** If the profile and a previous email
   (even one the user sent) disagree, the profile wins and the discrepancy is
   flagged in the report. Terms change; old wording lingers in sent mail.
5. **Updating facts.** When the user says "our affiliate rate is now 25%" or "add
   this to my profile", edit the right file in their profile folder (never the
   plugin's templates, never the demo profile) and confirm what changed.
6. **Never copy profile contents anywhere public.** The profile holds commercial
   terms. It stays on the user's machine.

## First-time setup

If `inbox profile-dir` shows a folder full of `TODO`s, hand over to the
`inbox-setup` skill ("set up my inbox profile"). It interviews the user, reads
their website to pre-fill `company.md`, and writes the files with them.
