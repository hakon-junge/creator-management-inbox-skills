  Build or update the voice profile (voice.md) the inbox drafts use: reads recent sent
  emails (read-only), a short interview, writes voice.md in their private profile, sets
  house style, proves it with sample replies. Use during inbox setup, when inbox drafts
  sound generic or keep getting the same edit, or when comms-style finds voice.md
  unfilled. With the Your Voice plugin installed, its your-voice-builder builds the one
  voice both use.

# Voice builder

**Your Voice installed?** Use its `your-voice-builder` instead and stop: one voice for
every tool, which `comms-style` reads first. Else the goal is a `voice.md` they send
unedited; the model answer is `../comms-style/references/example-voice.md` (fictional).

Time budget: about 10 minutes of the user's time. Do the heavy lifting yourself.

## Step 1 - Gather their real writing

Run `inbox profile-dir` to find the profile folder, then:

- **Gmail connected** (`provider: gmail`): `inbox sent-samples --max 40`. Their own
  emails from the last 180 days, quotes stripped. Prefer creator and partner
  threads; skip internal one-liners and auto-replies.
- **Demo mode or not connected yet**: ask them to paste 5-10 emails they wrote
  (creator emails if possible - a negotiation, a piece of feedback, a decline,
  a quick reply). Pasted text is enough.
- **Nothing to sample** (brand new to email outreach): skip to Step 2 and build
  from the interview alone; mark the profile "interview-based, refine after 20
  sent emails".

Treat samples as private. You may quote the user's own sentences into `voice.md`,
but replace other people's names with `[Name]` and deal figures with `[fee]` or
`[views]`. Never copy samples anywhere else.

## Step 2 - The interview (short, plain questions)

Ask in small groups, offering options where you can (use the question tool if
available). Skip anything the samples already answer clearly - say what you
noticed instead and ask them to confirm.

1. "Three words you'd want a creator to use to describe your emails?"
2. "How do you usually open an email to a creator?" (show two openers you found)
3. "Emoji: never, rarely at the end, or freely? Which ones?"
4. "Exclamation marks: fine, or avoid?"
5. "Any words or phrases you never want in your emails?" (examples: "honestly",
   "per my last email", "circle back", em dashes)
6. "When you say no to a creator, what matters most to you?"
7. "When you negotiate, do you show how you got to a number?"
8. "How do you sign off?"

Answers to 3-5 also go into `settings.md`:
- em dashes off -> `em_dashes: replace`
- words to ban -> `banned_words: word=replacement, ...` (suggest a replacement for each,
  e.g. honestly=genuinely: announcing honesty implies the rest was optional)
- avoid exclamation marks -> `exclamation_marks: avoid`

Edit only inside the ```settings block. Tell them what you changed.

## Step 3 - Analyse, then write voice.md

Work through the samples section by section, the way the example voice is laid out:

| Section | What to extract |
|---|---|
| Core voice | 4-7 traits, each with the reason it works and a short real example |
| Openers and greetings | first-email, reply and quick-ack patterns, with examples |
| Email shapes | their actual structure for: first reply to an interested creator, content feedback, a rate conversation, a decline, a wrap-up |
| Formatting | dashes, bullets, bold, paragraph length, emoji (which, where, how often), exclamation marks, link style, P.S. |
| Sign-offs | how they close; whether they type their name |
| Negotiation voice | how they present numbers, concede, hold, exit |
| Your phrases | 5-15 lines they really use, quoted |
| Never | words, openers, habits absent from or rejected in their writing |

Rules for a profile that actually works:
- **Evidence over adjectives.** "Warm" is useless alone. "Warm through word choice -
  'really', 'love' - not emoji" is usable. Every trait gets an example.
- **Frequencies, not absolutes, where true.** "About one email in four ends with an
  emoji" beats "uses emoji".
- **Contradictions are information.** If they write differently to new creators than to
  long-time partners, record both.
- **Their words, not yours.** Don't upgrade their phrasing into polished copy.
- Keep it under ~1,200 words. A bloated profile makes drafts generic, not specific.

Write the result to `voice.md` in their profile folder (replace the template). Title
line: `# Voice profile: <their name>`.

## Step 4 - Prove it

Draft three short replies in the new voice, as text in the chat (don't save drafts):
use three emails from the active demo (`inbox unread`: a money ask, a content review, a
date) or three real unread threads if they prefer. Ask: "Would you send
these as they are? What would you change?"

Fold every correction back into `voice.md` - as a principle ("never opens with
'Thanks for reaching out'"), not as a one-off note. Repeat until they'd send the
drafts unchanged, usually one or two rounds.

## Updating an existing voice

- "Update my voice" / "my drafts keep saying X": read `voice.md`, make the smallest
  change that fixes it, and show the diff.
- After a few inbox runs, `inbox score` shows how often drafts were sent unedited and
  what changed when they weren't. Two or more edits pointing the same way = propose a
  voice.md change, and apply it only when the user agrees.
- Keep the profile tight: fold new rules into existing sections; don't append a log.
